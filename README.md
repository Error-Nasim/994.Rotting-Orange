## 📖 About The Project

This project provides a comprehensive, beginner-friendly explanation of the classic "Rotting Oranges" algorithmic problem. It breaks down complex concepts into digestible sections with visual aids, animations, and real-world analogies.

### Problem Overview

Given a grid representing a warehouse of oranges where:

- `0` = Empty cell
- `1` = Fresh orange
- `2` = Rotten orange

Every minute, rotten oranges infect adjacent fresh oranges (up, down, left, right). The goal is to determine the minimum time for all oranges to rot, or return `-1` if impossible.

## ✨ Features

- 📊 **Visual Grid Demonstrations** - See the rot spread step-by-step
- 🎯 **Interactive Examples** - Multiple test cases explained in detail
- 🧠 **BFS Concept Explained** - Clear breakdown of the algorithm
- 💻 **Code Walkthrough** - Line-by-line implementation guide
- 🎨 **Clean, Responsive Design** - Works on all devices
- 📱 **Progressive Navigation** - Learn at your own pace
